# Goldfish Swimming CSS Animation

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/mephysto/pen/yapYNX](https://codepen.io/mephysto/pen/yapYNX).

Gold fish swimming animation using only CSS.
I cut up the goldfish into different pieces (using Photoshop), then used Spritesmith to create the spritesheet. 
After that it's pretty much using CSS transforms and animations to make the magic happen
